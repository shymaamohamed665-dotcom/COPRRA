# Final Audit Certificate v2

Date: 2025-10-20
Environment: Windows (PowerShell), Laravel project root `c:\Users\Gaser\Desktop\COPRRA`

## Executive Summary
- Test suite stable: `OK (2082 tests, 5505 assertions)` after enhancing event payload assertion.
- New feature tests verified present on disk:
  - `tests/Feature/OrderServiceCoverageTest.php`
  - `tests/Feature/FinancialTransactionServiceCoverageTest.php`
- Active assets inventory regenerated: `active_assets.log` (46,515 bytes) with curated trees for `routes`, `tests/Feature`, `app/Enums`, `app/Models`, `app/Services`, `database/factories`, `config`, and a top-level directory listing.
- Psalm executed with full output captured at `raw_outputs_v6/psalm_full_output.txt`.

## Evidence and Commands
- PHPUnit run (full suite):
  - Command: `php .\phpunit.phar --colors=never`
  - Result: `OK (2082 tests, 5505 assertions)`

- File presence verification:
  - Command: `dir tests\Feature\OrderServiceCoverageTest.php; dir tests\Feature\FinancialTransactionServiceCoverageTest.php`
  - Result: Both files exist; sizes: 8042 bytes and 5736 bytes respectively.

- Active assets inventory generation:
  - Commands (PowerShell):
    - `tree /A /F routes | Out-File -FilePath active_assets.tmp -Encoding utf8`
    - `"" | Out-File -Append -FilePath active_assets.tmp`
    - `tree /A /F tests\Feature | Out-File -Append -FilePath active_assets.tmp`
    - `tree /A /F app\Enums | Out-File -Append -FilePath active_assets.tmp`
    - `tree /A /F app\Models | Out-File -Append -FilePath active_assets.tmp`
    - `tree /A /F app\Services | Out-File -Append -FilePath active_assets.tmp`
    - `tree /A /F database\factories | Out-File -Append -FilePath active_assets.tmp`
    - `tree /A /F config | Out-File -Append -FilePath active_assets.tmp`
    - `Get-ChildItem -Name | Out-File -Append -FilePath active_assets.tmp`
    - `Move-Item -Force -Path active_assets.tmp -Destination active_assets.log`

- Psalm run and capture:
  - Commands (PowerShell):
    - `if (!(Test-Path raw_outputs_v6)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path raw_outputs_v6 }`
    - `php vendor\bin\psalm --no-cache --show-info=true | Tee-Object -FilePath raw_outputs_v6\psalm_full_output.txt`
  - Summary (tail of output):
    - `1 errors found`
    - `4024 other issues found.`
    - `Psalm can automatically fix 703 issues.`
    - `Checks took 66.45 seconds and used 843.004MB of memory`
    - `Psalm was able to infer types for 94.7175% of the codebase`

## Test Enhancements Implemented
- Enhanced `OrderServiceCoverageTest::testUpdateOrderStatusAcceptsCompletedAliasAsDeliveredAndFiresEvent` to assert event payload:
  - From `oldStatus=SHIPPED` to `newStatus=DELIVERED` with the correct `order` reference.
  - Verified via `Event::assertDispatched(OrderStatusChanged::class, fn($event) => ...)`.

## Artifacts Created/Updated
- `active_assets.log` — latest curated inventory of active assets.
- `tests/Feature/OrderServiceCoverageTest.php` — updated with stricter event payload assertion.
- `raw_outputs_v6/psalm_full_output.txt` — full, stable Psalm output with clear summary.
- `final_audit_certificate_v2.md` — this certificate.

## Conclusion
- The project is now verified stable with a green test suite, strengthened coverage for status aliasing/events, and complete, reproducible audit artifacts. The Psalm report has been captured with a clear summary; addressing reported issues can be planned separately without affecting current stability.

## Suggested Follow-ups (Optional)
- Prioritize reducing Psalm errors by enabling targeted `--alter` dry-run flows as suggested by Psalm and iterating module-by-module.
- Consider CI steps to archive `active_assets.log` and `raw_outputs_v6` artifacts per build for traceability.
