# State of the Project â€” Final Audit Cycle

## Executive Summary
The COPRRA platform has been elevated to an enterprise-grade standard with clean repository hygiene, robust monitoring and observability, tightened CI/CD checks, and foundational QA automation. The codebase is lean, documented, and protected by hooks and policies to maintain long-term quality.

## Before / After Improvements

| Area                | Before                                  | After                                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Repo Size           | Polluted with large debris (release, txt)| Lean root, `.gitignore` hardened; debris auto-blocked  |
| Dev Setup           | Inconsistent local env                   | Docker-first, compose services (app/mysql/redis/mailhog)|
| Monitoring          | Missing centralized error capture        | Sentry integrated, test route `/sentry-test`           |
| Health Checks       | Basic/missing                            | DB/Cache/Storage/Queue covered via `/health`           |
| BackupService       | Duplicate implementations                | Consolidated to canonical service                      |
| CI Nginx            | No validation                            | Docker-based config validation added                    |
| Mutation Testing    | Lenient/unset in workflow                | Infection enforced (MSI/Covered MSI = 60%)             |
| Security Audits     | Partial                                  | Composer/NPM/PHPStan/Psalm/PHPMD/Deptrac/Gitleaks run  |
| Dependency Updates  | Manual                                   | Dependabot weekly for Composer & NPM                   |

## Major Remediated Issues
- Removed duplicate and legacy files; consolidated `BackupService`
- Hardened `.gitignore` and added `scripts/cleanup.sh` for preventive cleanup
- Modernized Husky hooks (no deprecated wrappers), added debris guard
- Integrated Sentry and added simple validation route for capture
- Enhanced `HealthController` with DB/Cache/Storage/Queue checks
- Standardized Docker Compose including MySQL, Redis, Mailhog, and Nginx
- Added k6 load test baseline (`tests/load/api-load-test.js`)
- Added a foundational Laravel Dusk test (`tests/Browser/LoginTest.php`)
- Tuned PHPMD ruleset for pragmatic enforcement
- Enforced Infection MSI at 60% and removed lenient flags from workflows
- Added `dependabot.yml` for weekly automated updates

## Roadmap (Future Sprints)
- E2E Coverage: Expand Laravel Dusk tests across registration, checkout, and admin flows
- Performance: Grow k6 scenarios (spikes, soak, thresholds per endpoint)
- Real-Time Features: Introduce websockets (e.g., product price updates, order status)
- Observability: Add tracing (OpenTelemetry), dashboarding for health metrics
- Security: Add periodic penetration testing; enhance CSP for stricter policies
- Docs: Expand runbooks (backup/restore, incident response) and developer onboarding videos

## Verification
- CI/CD: All workflows updated; Nginx config validated via Docker; mutation testing thresholds configured
- Hooks: Pre-commit/pre-push now enforce quality without deprecated wrappers
- Documentation: README (Tech Stack, Docker-first, hooks), CLAUDE.md (updated guidance), `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
