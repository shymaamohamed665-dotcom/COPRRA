Dry Run Verification Report â€” fix_tools.ps1
Date: 2025-10-20

Summary
- Implemented global DryRun gating across fix_tools.ps1 for file/list writes.
- Restarted a dry run and observed only DRYRUN "Would ..." messages for item processing.
- No additional placeholder files or list updates occurred after the gated restart.

Key Evidence from Logs
- Start of gated run: [2025-10-20 14:17:23] "Starting processing 664 items."
- Subsequent messages show only DRYRUN actions, for example:
  - [2025-10-20 14:17:29] DRYRUN: Would process 'SecurityScanningTest' (path='SecurityScanningTest.php')
  - [2025-10-20 14:20:33] DRYRUN: Would process 'AccessControlListTest' (path='AccessControlListTest.php')
- No "Processed and moved" lines after 14:17 in the tail, and DRYRUN messages dominate.

Code Changes (selected checkpoints)
- Gated initial file bootstrap:
  - if ($DryRun) { Write-Log "DRYRUN: Would create fixed list file: $fixedPath" }
  - if ($DryRun) { Write-Log "DRYRUN: Would merge legacy fixed item into fixed list: $line" }
- Gated write helpers:
  - Write-Skipped: logs DRYRUN and skips file append.
  - Remove-Item-From-List: logs DRYRUN and skips file rewrite.
- Gated placeholder creation:
  - Ensure-Exists-Or-Create: logs DRYRUN and returns early instead of New-Item/Set-Content.
- Gated strictness enforcement:
  - Ensure-Strictness: logs DRYRUN and returns.
- Gated per-item processing and list updates:
  - Blocks around Add-Content to $fixedPath/$suggestionsPath now DRYRUN-only with early returns.

Observations
- Prior to the gated restart, the log contains earlier writes (e.g., ~14:14):
  - "Created placeholder file: ... placeholder_QueryPerformanceAnalyzer.md"
  - "Created placeholder test: ... IndexOptimizationTest.php"
- These earlier entries predate the applied gating and remain in the repo.

Conclusions
- After gating and restart, dry run behavior is correct: actions are simulated only.
- No evidence of file creation or list mutation in the gated run segment.

Recommendations
- Optionally clean up placeholders/tests created before 14:17 if they are undesired.
- Consider adding a final guard that throws if any write commands are invoked while $DryRun is true (defensive layer), e.g., wrapping New-Item/Set-Content/Add-Content in helper functions that assert !$DryRun.

Next Steps
- If needed, run another dry run with a small MaxItems (e.g., 30) to confirm stability.
- Proceed to real run without -DryRun once ready.
