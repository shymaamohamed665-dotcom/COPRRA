# Final Audit Certificate

This certificate evaluates mandatory checklist items before proceeding to CI, confirming or denying compliance with evidence from the repository and fresh executions.

## Overall Result
Partial compliance. Strict PHPUnit configuration and PHPStan are confirmed clean; active test run evidence exists (OK: 2071 tests) but a fresh re-run captured partial output and did not complete; Psalm clean status lacks an explicit final "No issues" line in the latest saved output; the two newly referenced coverage tests are not present in the repository.

## Checklist Evaluation

1) Active Assets Verification
- Finding: Active assets count documented as 309 in `inventory_and_triage_report.md`.
- Evidence:
  - `inventory_and_triage_report.md`: "عدد الأصول النشطة: 309 (راجع `active_assets.log`)."
  - Attempted to locate `active_assets.log` — file not found via recursive search.
- Decision: Partial — count documented, but source log (`active_assets.log`) is missing in repo for direct verification.

2) Run All Active Tests (PHPUnit)
- Finding: Last recorded full run succeeded; fresh re-run captured partial progress and exited non‑zero.
- Evidence:
  - `test_results\phpunit_latest.out`:
    - Summary: `OK (2071 tests, 5454 assertions)`; Time: ~07:57, Memory ~280MB.
  - Fresh re-run: `final_audit_outputs\phpunit_run_latest.out` shows `... 366 / 2079 ( 17%)` but command exited with code 1 (partial capture, run not completed in this environment).
  - `phpunit.xml` defines all active suites: Unit, Feature, AI, Security, Performance, Integration.
- Decision: Partial — latest known good run is OK (2071 tests). A fresh full run did not complete; current test count appears to be 2079, but pass/fail cannot be confirmed from the partial output.

3) Confirm Strict Settings in `phpunit.xml`
- Finding: Strict flags are enabled.
- Evidence (`phpunit.xml`):
  - `failOnWarning="true"`, `failOnRisky="true"`, `stopOnFailure="true"`, `beStrictAboutChangesToGlobalState="true"`, `beStrictAboutTestsThatDoNotTestAnything="true"`, `beStrictAboutOutputDuringTests="true"`, `failOnDeprecation="true"`.
- Decision: Pass.

4) PHPStan — Re-run and Confirm "No errors"
- Finding: Clean output confirmed.
- Evidence:
  - `raw_outputs_v4\phpstan_output.txt`:
    - `Note: Using configuration file C:\Users\Gaser\Desktop\COPRRA\phpstan.neon.`
    - `[OK] No errors`
- Decision: Pass.

5) Psalm — Re-run and Confirm "No errors"
- Finding: Latest saved output shows analysis progress without a final summary. Prior report states clean; current file lacks explicit "No issues" line.
- Evidence:
  - `raw_outputs_v4\psalm_output.txt`: shows progress blocks up to ~`480/521` without final status.
  - `code_quality_final_fixes_report.md`: "Psalm: Clean — saved to `raw_outputs_v4/psalm_output.txt`."
- Decision: Partial — clean status claimed, but explicit final "No issues" evidence not present in the stored output.

6) Document Decision to Disable `findUnusedBaselineEntry` in Psalm
- Finding: Disabled with justification.
- Evidence:
  - `psalm.xml`: `findUnusedBaselineEntry="false"` with `baseline="psalm-baseline.xml"` and `errorLevel="1"`.
  - `code_quality_final_fixes_report.md`: rationale documented under "Psalm Baseline Hygiene".
- Decision: Pass.

7) Confirm Presence and Functionality of New Tests
- Finding: Referenced tests not present in repository.
- Evidence:
  - `coverage_and_enhancement_report.md` references:
    - `tests/Feature/OrderServiceCoverageTest.php`
    - `tests/Feature/FinancialTransactionServiceCoverageTest.php`
  - Repository search: no matching files under `tests/` or `release/tests/`.
- Decision: Fail — files absent; functionality cannot be confirmed.

8) Review Recent Raw Outputs for Unexpected Errors or Warnings
- Finding: No occurrences of `error`, `warning`, or `fatal` found in `raw_outputs_v*` scan.
- Evidence:
  - Scan file: `final_audit_outputs\raw_outputs_scan.out` (empty after filtering), built from `raw_outputs_v*` directories.
- Decision: Pass — no unexpected errors/warnings detected in recent raw outputs.

## Evidence Index
- `phpunit.xml` — strict flags enabled.
- `test_results\phpunit_latest.out` — OK (2071 tests, 5454 assertions).
- `final_audit_outputs\phpunit_run_latest.out` — partial fresh run indicates 2079 tests, exited non-zero.
- `raw_outputs_v4\phpstan_output.txt` — `[OK] No errors`.
- `raw_outputs_v4\psalm_output.txt` — analysis progress (no final summary line present).
- `inventory_and_triage_report.md` — active assets count (309) referencing `active_assets.log`.
- `coverage_and_enhancement_report.md` — references to absent coverage test files.
- `final_audit_outputs\raw_outputs_scan.out` — empty scan results for `error|warning|fatal`.

## Non-Compliance Summary and Recommendations (No fixes applied)
- New coverage tests missing: add `OrderServiceCoverageTest.php` and `FinancialTransactionServiceCoverageTest.php` under `tests/Feature/` and re-run full suite.
- Active assets log missing: regenerate `active_assets.log` or include it in the repo to substantiate the 309 count.
- Psalm final status: re-run Psalm and save a complete output file that includes the explicit final summary line (e.g., "No issues" or numeric counts of issues).
- Fresh full PHPUnit run: execute in a stable environment (no pipeline redirection) and capture summary to confirm the updated count (2079) passes.
