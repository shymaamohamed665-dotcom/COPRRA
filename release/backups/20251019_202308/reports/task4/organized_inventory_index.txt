Title: COPRRA Project Tools and Tests Inventory (Organized Rewrite)
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-10-17

This index points to the final organized, deduplicated rewrite with strict sequential numbering. The full list is split into parts to keep files small and readable.

Files:
- organized_inventory_part1.txt  (Items 1–88: AI models, Configuration, Scripts, Test Support, Architecture, Benchmarks)
- organized_inventory_part2a.txt (Items 89–150: AI tests, Browser tests, Feature tests — part 1)
- organized_inventory_part2b.txt (Items 151–190: Feature tests — part 2)
- organized_inventory_part3.txt  (Items 191–253: Integration, Performance, Security, Unit, Other tests)
- organized_inventory_part4.txt  (Items 254–275: Vendor tools + Totals)

Notes:
- All entries are one-by-one and deduplicated.
- Numbering is strict and continuous across all parts.
- This is the same organized rewrite I provided, saved into files for easier discovery.
