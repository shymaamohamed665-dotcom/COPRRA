# Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

This project includes a comprehensive test suite covering unit tests, feature tests, integration tests, performance tests, and security tests.

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests (`tests/Unit/`)

- **Models**: Test model relationships, validations, and business logic
- **Services**: Test service classes and their methods
- **Providers**: Test service provider registration and boot methods
- **Factories**: Test model factories for data generation

### Feature Tests (`tests/Feature/`)

- **API Tests**: Test API endpoints and responses
- **Controller Tests**: Test HTTP controllers and their methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows and system integration
- **Performance Tests**: Test application performance and response times
- **Security Tests**: Test security measures and vulnerability prevention

### Benchmarks (`tests/Benchmarks/`)

- **Performance Benchmarks**: Measure and validate application performance
- **Memory Usage Tests**: Monitor memory consumption
- **Concurrent Request Tests**: Test system under load

### Security Tests (`tests/Security/`)

- **Security Audit**: Comprehensive security testing
- **Vulnerability Tests**: Test against common security vulnerabilities
- **Authentication Tests**: Test user authentication and authorization

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

```bash
php artisan test
```

### Run Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Unit tests only
php artisan test --testsuite=Unit

# Feature tests only
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature

# Performance tests only
php artisan test --filter=Performance

# Security tests only
php artisan test --filter=Security
```

### Run with Coverage

```bash
php artisan test --coverage-html coverage
```

### Run Benchmarks

```bash
php artisan test tests/Benchmarks/
```

## Test Configuration

### Environment Setup

Tests run in a separate testing environment with:

- In-memory SQLite database
- Array cache driver
- Mail array driver
- Disabled encryption for faster execution

### Test Data

- Uses Laravel factories for consistent test data generation
- Database is refreshed between tests using `RefreshDatabase` trait
- Faker is used for generating realistic test data

## Performance Benchmarks

### Product Search Performance

- Tests search performance with 1000+ products
- Measures response time and memory usage
- Validates performance requirements

### Database Query Performance

- Tests complex queries with relationships
- Measures query execution time
- Validates query optimization

### Memory Usage

- Monitors memory consumption during operations
- Tests with large datasets
- Validates memory efficiency

### Concurrent Requests

- Simulates multiple simultaneous requests
- Tests system stability under load
- Validates response times

## Security Testing

### Password Security

- Tests password strength requirements
- Validates password hashing
- Tests password policies

### SQL Injection Prevention

- Tests malicious SQL input handling
- Validates query parameterization
- Tests database security

### XSS Prevention

- Tests malicious script injection
- Validates output sanitization
- Tests content security

### CSRF Protection

- Tests cross-site request forgery prevention
- Validates token validation
- Tests form security

### Authentication & Authorization

- Tests user authentication
- Validates access control
- Tests session management

### File Upload Security

- Tests malicious file upload prevention
- Validates file type restrictions
- Tests upload security

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

Automated testing on:

- PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
- Multiple database drivers
- Security audits
- Performance testing

### Test Reports

- Code coverage reports
- Performance metrics
- Security audit results
- Test result summaries

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests

1. Use descriptive test method names
2. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
3. Test one thing per test method
4. Use factories for test data
5. Clean up after tests

### Performance Testing

1. Test with realistic data volumes
2. Measure actual performance metrics
3. Set reasonable performance thresholds
4. Monitor memory usage
5. Test under load

### Security Testing

1. Test all input validation
2. Test authentication and authorization
3. Test for common vulnerabilities
4. Validate security headers
5. Test error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Encryption errors**: Ensure APP_KEY is properly set
2. **Database errors**: Check database configuration
3. **Memory issues**: Increase PHP memory limit
4. **Timeout issues**: Increase test timeout settings

### Debug Mode

Run tests with verbose output:

```bash
php artisan test --verbose
```

### Test Isolation

Ensure tests don't depend on each other:

- Use `RefreshDatabase` trait
- Clean up test data
- Use unique test data
- Avoid shared state
