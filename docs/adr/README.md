# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the COPRRA platform.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document the significant architectural decisions made in the project, including:
- The context and forces that led to the decision
- The decision itself
- The consequences (both positive and negative) of that decision

ADRs help team members understand why certain architectural choices were made and provide historical context for future decisions.

## ADR Format

All ADRs follow the template defined in `0000-template.md` and include:

1. **Title**: Short, descriptive name (e.g., "Use of Service Classes for Business Logic")
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The issue or situation motivating the decision
4. **Decision**: What was decided and why
5. **Consequences**: Positive, negative, and neutral outcomes

## Current ADRs

| Number | Title | Status | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| [0001](0001-use-of-service-classes-for-business-logic.md) | Use of Service Classes for Business Logic | Accepted | 2025-10-23 |
| [0002](0002-adoption-of-specialized-test-suites.md) | Adoption of Specialized Test Suites | Accepted | 2025-10-23 |

## Creating a New ADR

1. **Copy the template**:
   ```bash
   cp docs/adr/0000-template.md docs/adr/XXXX-your-decision-title.md
   ```

2. **Use the next sequential number** (e.g., 0003, 0004)

3. **Fill in all sections**:
   - Provide clear context
   - Explain the decision rationally
   - Document all significant consequences
   - Link to related resources

4. **Use a descriptive filename**:
   - Format: `XXXX-brief-description-with-hyphens.md`
   - Example: `0003-adopt-event-driven-architecture.md`

5. **Set the status**:
   - `Proposed`: Under discussion
   - `Accepted`: Approved and implemented
   - `Deprecated`: No longer relevant
   - `Superseded`: Replaced by another ADR

6. **Update this README** with the new ADR in the table above

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:
- ✅ Are difficult or costly to reverse
- ✅ Affect multiple parts of the system
- ✅ Have significant trade-offs
- ✅ Set patterns for future development
- ✅ Require team alignment

**Examples**:
- Choice of framework or major libraries
- Architectural patterns (service layer, repository, event-driven)
- Database schema design approaches
- API versioning strategy
- Testing strategy
- Security patterns

## When NOT to Create an ADR

Don't create an ADR for:
- ❌ Routine implementation details
- ❌ Tactical, easily reversible decisions
- ❌ Technology choices with no alternatives
- ❌ Decisions that only affect a single component

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: ADR is created and under review
2. **Accepted**: Team agrees and decision is implemented
3. **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer followed (document why)
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR (link to replacement)

## Modifying Existing ADRs

**Don't modify accepted ADRs** except to:
- Fix typos or improve clarity
- Mark as deprecated/superseded
- Add references to related ADRs

If circumstances change and you need to change an architectural decision:
1. Create a new ADR documenting the new decision
2. Mark the old ADR as "Superseded by ADR-XXXX"
3. Link between the old and new ADRs

## Benefits of ADRs

- **Knowledge Sharing**: New team members understand past decisions
- **Context Preservation**: Capture the "why" not just the "what"
- **Decision Transparency**: Makes architectural choices visible
- **Avoiding Repeats**: Prevents revisiting already-decided questions
- **Accountability**: Shows who decided what and when
