# 2. Adoption of Specialized Test Suites

**Date:** 2025-10-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As COPRRA evolved from a simple price comparison tool to a comprehensive e-commerce platform with AI features, security requirements, and performance benchmarks, our test suite grew to **696 tests** covering diverse aspects of the application.

### Initial Testing Challenges:

1. **Long Test Execution Times**:
   - Running all tests sequentially took 15+ minutes
   - Developers avoided running full suite before commits
   - CI/CD pipelines were slow

2. **Mixed Test Types**:
   - Unit tests mixed with integration tests
   - Security tests ran alongside feature tests
   - Performance benchmarks slowed down functional tests

3. **Unclear Test Organization**:
   - Hard to identify which tests broke when failures occurred
   - Difficult to run only relevant tests for specific changes
   - No clear categorization of test purposes

4. **CI/CD Inefficiency**:
   - All tests ran even for minor changes
   - Couldn't parallelize different test types
   - No way to prioritize critical test categories

5. **Development Workflow Issues**:
   - Developers couldn't easily run "just unit tests" for quick feedback
   - Security testing delayed until full test run
   - Performance regressions detected too late

### Business Requirements:

- **Fast Feedback**: Developers need quick test results during development
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Enterprise-grade security and performance testing required
- **CI/CD Optimization**: Parallel test execution to reduce pipeline time
- **Test Clarity**: Easy to understand test failures and their scope
- **Selective Testing**: Run only relevant tests for specific changes

### Technical Constraints:

- PHPUnit 11 test framework
- Laravel 12 testing utilities
- SQLite in-memory database for speed
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with matrix support
- PHPStan Level max requires strict testing standards

## Decision

**We will organize tests into six specialized test suites**, each with distinct purposes, execution contexts, and performance characteristics.

### Test Suite Architecture:

#### 1. **Unit Test Suite** (`tests/Unit/`)
- **Purpose**: Test isolated components without framework dependencies
- **Scope**: Single classes, methods, functions
- **Dependencies**: Minimal, mocks for external services
- **Execution Time**: < 30 seconds
- **Use Case**: Quick feedback during development

#### 2. **Feature Test Suite** (`tests/Feature/`)
- **Purpose**: Test integration with Laravel framework
- **Scope**: Controllers, middleware, routes, database interactions
- **Dependencies**: Full Laravel stack, in-memory database
- **Execution Time**: 1-2 minutes
- **Use Case**: Verify HTTP workflows and database operations

#### 3. **AI Test Suite** (`tests/AI/`)
- **Purpose**: Test AI service integrations and ML features
- **Scope**: OpenAI API integration, product classification, recommendations
- **Dependencies**: AI service mocks, sample datasets
- **Execution Time**: 30-60 seconds
- **Use Case**: Verify AI features without hitting production APIs

#### 4. **Security Test Suite** (`tests/Security/`)
- **Purpose**: Validate security controls and vulnerability protection
- **Scope**: XSS prevention, CSRF protection, SQL injection, authentication
- **Dependencies**: Security testing utilities
- **Execution Time**: 1-2 minutes
- **Use Case**: Ensure enterprise-grade security standards

#### 5. **Performance Test Suite** (`tests/Performance/`)
- **Purpose**: Benchmark performance and detect regressions
- **Scope**: Query optimization, caching effectiveness, response times
- **Dependencies**: Performance profiling tools
- **Execution Time**: 2-3 minutes
- **Use Case**: Monitor performance metrics and prevent degradation

#### 6. **Integration Test Suite** (`tests/Integration/`)
- **Purpose**: Test end-to-end workflows across multiple systems
- **Scope**: Multi-store integrations, payment processing, webhooks
- **Dependencies**: External service mocks/stubs
- **Execution Time**: 2-3 minutes
- **Use Case**: Verify complete business workflows

### PHPUnit Configuration:

```xml
<testsuites>
    <testsuite name="Unit">
        <directory suffix="Test.php">./tests/Unit</directory>
    </testsuite>
    <testsuite name="Feature">
        <directory suffix="Test.php">./tests/Feature</directory>
    </testsuite>
    <testsuite name="AI">
        <directory suffix="Test.php">./tests/AI</directory>
    </testsuite>
    <testsuite name="Security">
        <directory suffix="Test.php">./tests/Security</directory>
    </testsuite>
    <testsuite name="Performance">
        <directory suffix="Test.php">./tests/Performance</directory>
    </testsuite>
    <testsuite name="Integration">
        <directory suffix="Test.php">./tests/Integration</directory>
    </testsuite>
</testsuites>
```

### Composer Scripts:

```json
{
  "test:unit": "vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Unit",
  "test:feature": "vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Feature",
  "test:ai": "vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite AI",
  "test:security": "vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Security",
  "test:performance": "vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Performance",
  "test:integration": "vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Integration",
  "test:comprehensive": "vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration=phpunit.xml"
}
```

### CI/CD Integration:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    suite: [Unit, Feature, AI, Security, Performance, Integration]
steps:
  - run: composer test:${{ matrix.suite }}
```

### Alternatives Considered and Rejected:

1. **Single Monolithic Test Suite**:
   - ❌ Rejected: 15+ minute execution time
   - ❌ No parallelization possible
   - ❌ Hard to identify test failure scope
   - ❌ Developer experience suffers

2. **Test Tags/Groups Only (No Suites)**:
   - ⚠️ Considered: PHPUnit supports @group annotations
   - ❌ Rejected: Tags are harder to enforce
   - ❌ No directory structure organization
   - ❌ Developers might forget to add tags

3. **Separate Repositories for Test Types**:
   - ❌ Rejected: Increased maintenance burden
   - ❌ Version synchronization issues
   - ❌ Harder to run comprehensive tests

4. **Three-Tier Model Only (Unit/Integration/E2E)**:
   - ⚠️ Common pattern in many projects
   - ❌ Too coarse-grained for COPRRA's needs
   - ❌ Security and performance tests lack clear home
   - ❌ AI tests would be mixed with regular features

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Faster Development Feedback**:
   - Unit tests run in < 30 seconds
   - Developers can iterate quickly
   - **Example**: `composer test:unit` during TDD cycles

2. **Parallel CI/CD Execution**:
   - 6 test suites run concurrently in GitHub Actions
   - Total CI/CD time reduced from 15 minutes to ~3 minutes
   - **Matrix strategy** enables efficient parallelization

3. **Targeted Testing**:
   - Working on AI features? Run `composer test:ai`
   - Reviewing security changes? Run `composer test:security`
   - Pull requests can run only relevant suites

4. **Clear Test Purpose**:
   - Test location indicates its purpose immediately
   - New developers understand test organization intuitively
   - Code reviews can focus on appropriate test coverage

5. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Dedicated performance suite catches regressions early
   - Benchmarks tracked over time
   - Performance baselines documented

6. **Security Compliance**:
   - Dedicated security suite ensures critical protections tested
   - Easy to demonstrate security test coverage to auditors
   - **Current Result**: 95%+ coverage including security tests

7. **Test Isolation**:
   - Unit tests don't depend on database
   - Feature tests use in-memory SQLite
   - Integration tests mock external services
   - **Benefit**: Tests remain fast and reliable

### Negative

1. **More Configuration**:
   - PHPUnit.xml requires testsuite definitions
   - Composer.json has multiple test scripts
   - **Mitigation**: Configuration is one-time setup

2. **Directory Structure Enforcement**:
   - Developers must place tests in correct directories
   - Wrong directory = test doesn't run in expected suite
   - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation in CLAUDE.md

3. **Potential Duplication**:
   - Some tests might fit multiple categories
   - Risk of testing same thing in multiple suites
   - **Mitigation**: Clear guidelines on test placement

4. **Learning Curve**:
   - New contributors need to understand suite purposes
   - **Mitigation**: ADR and CLAUDE.md documentation

5. **CI/CD Complexity**:
   - Matrix strategy adds complexity to workflows
   - Need to aggregate results from parallel runs
   - **Mitigation**: GitHub Actions handles this well

### Neutral

1. **Test Count Distribution**:
   - Not all suites have equal test counts
   - Some suites grow faster than others
   - **Current Status**: Balanced distribution

2. **Execution Time Variance**:
   - Different suites take different amounts of time
   - Performance suite naturally slower than unit tests
   - **Acceptable**: Expected and manageable

## Test Suite Decision Matrix

When adding a new test, developers use this decision matrix:

| Suite | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **Unit** | Testing single class/method without Laravel framework |
| **Feature** | Testing controllers, routes, middleware with Laravel |
| **AI** | Testing AI service integrations, ML features |
| **Security** | Testing XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, authentication |
| **Performance** | Benchmarking query performance, caching effectiveness |
| **Integration** | Testing complete workflows across multiple services |
