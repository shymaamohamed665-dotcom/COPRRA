# ADR-001: Use Laravel Framework

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2024-01-15

## Context

COPRRA is an enterprise-grade e-commerce and price comparison platform requiring:
- Rapid development with proven patterns
- Robust ORM for complex data relationships
- Built-in security features (CSRF, XSS prevention, authentication)
- Extensive package ecosystem
- Strong community support
- Production-ready deployment tools

PHP was chosen as the backend language due to team expertise and hosting requirements.

## Decision

We will use **Laravel 12** as the primary web application framework for COPRRA.

Key Laravel features we will leverage:
- Eloquent ORM for database operations
- Blade templating engine
- Sanctum for API authentication
- Queue system for async operations
- Event-driven architecture
- Comprehensive testing utilities (PHPUnit integration)
- Artisan CLI for custom commands

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Faster development**: Laravel's conventions and built-in features accelerate development
- **Security by default**: CSRF protection, secure password hashing, SQL injection prevention
- **Scalability**: Queue system, caching, database optimization tools built-in
- **Testing**: Excellent testing utilities and database factories
- **Community**: Extensive documentation, packages, and community support
- **Modern PHP**: Supports PHP 8.2+ with strict typing and modern features

### Negative

- **Framework coupling**: Application logic becomes tightly coupled to Laravel
- **Learning curve**: Team members unfamiliar with Laravel need training
- **Performance overhead**: Framework abstraction adds some overhead compared to raw PHP
- **Opinionated structure**: Must follow Laravel conventions even when not ideal

### Neutral

- **Monolithic start**: Laravel encourages monolithic architecture initially (can be modularized later)
- **Composer dependency**: Requires Composer for dependency management

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Symfony

**Pros**: More flexible, better for large-scale applications, long-term support (LTS)
**Cons**: Steeper learning curve, more boilerplate code, slower development

**Reason not chosen**: Laravel's rapid development capabilities and superior developer experience outweighed Symfony's flexibility for our timeline and team size.

### Alternative 2: Custom PHP Framework

**Pros**: Maximum control, minimal overhead, tailored to exact needs
**Cons**: Months of development time, security risks, maintenance burden, reinventing the wheel

**Reason not chosen**: Building a custom framework would delay MVP by 6+ months and introduce significant security and maintenance risks.

### Alternative 3: Node.js (Express/NestJS)

**Pros**: JavaScript full-stack, excellent for real-time features, modern ecosystem
**Cons**: Team lacks Node.js expertise, less mature e-commerce packages, different hosting requirements

**Reason not chosen**: Team expertise is in PHP, and Laravel's e-commerce ecosystem is more mature than Node.js alternatives.
